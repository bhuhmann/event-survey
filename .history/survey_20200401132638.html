            <!--The idea for the ranked-choice options is to do a drag-and-drop implementation similar to what 
            Survey Monkey has currently. Specifically, when a person drags and drops an item, the numbers of 
            all the items get initially set. Similar to the current implementation, the idea is that people 
            can also use a dropdown to select a specific rank for any particular item. However, we should have some
            check for / enforced agreement between manually set rank and drag-and-drop rank. Additionally, 
            unlike the current Survey Monkey implementation, we should allow for ties (maybe?) and allow for
            unranked items. For the actual vote tallying, Kevin suggests Condorcet.-->
